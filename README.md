# Latino New Jersey History Project

Thematic and narrative mapping exercises for the students in Dr. Lilia Fernandez's research project on the history of Latinos in New Jersey. 

The thematic maps presentation and worksheet uses [Social Explorer](https://www.socialexplorer.com). The presentation is an adaptation of Janine Billadello's ["Introduction to Social Explorer"](http://faculty.baruch.cuny.edu/geoportal/resources/census/social_explorer.pdf) (2015). 

The narrative maps portion uses [ArcGIS Story Maps](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/) and includes do-ahead work asking the students to prepare location data and a section outline.
